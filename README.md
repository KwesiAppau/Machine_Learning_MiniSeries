# Machine_Learning_MiniSeries
Hands-on machine learning projects from UTEP’s Summer 2025 Machine Learning Mini-Series, featuring notebooks that put theory into practice.

This repository contains five Python notebooks developed as part of the Machine Learning Mini-Series workshop hosted at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) during Summer 2025. The notebooks walk through fundamental concepts and practical implementations in machine learning, serving as a hands-on guide for beginners.

## Contents

### 1. Introduction to Machine Learning
- Overview of core ML concepts  
- First exposure to basic predictive models  

### 2. Regression with scikit-learn
- Implementation of linear and polynomial regression  
- Model training, evaluation, and interpretation with `scikit-learn`  

### 3. Classification with the Iris Dataset
- Applying supervised learning algorithms to the classic Iris dataset  
- Comparing performance across models  

### 4. Unsupervised Learning
- Dimensionality reduction with **t-SNE** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
- Clustering techniques for pattern discovery  

### 5. Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Introduction to deep learning workflows  
- Building and training a simple CNN for image classification  

## Purpose
This collection is designed as an **introductory resource**. It balances theoretical foundations with coding practice to help beginners gain confidence in exploring machine learning methods. While the notebooks only scratch the surface, they provide a structured foundation for further study.
